    choices here. In the “Remarks” field, you may leave your comments/remarks regarding
    the collection.</p>
  <p>If the observation is not possible for a reason, you may check “No observation possible”

  <img src="{% static "images/screenshots/edit_older.png" %}" class="card-img-top">
  <p>
  On the right side of the fields you may notice a set of buttons.
    These are the values from the previous collection. At the top,
    you will see the date to know exactly when that collection was
    created. You may also edit the values from the previous collection
    by selecting the field by clicking on it. In the opened window,
    choose the new value and click on save. Be aware that, you need
    to save the edited previous collection separately to update the
    values in the database. To do so, you need to save it in the Local
    Observations page.
  </p>
  <p>To speed up collection process you may also copy the values from
    previous collection by clicking on the “Copy from previous collection”
    <i class="bi bi-files" style="color: gray;"></i> button. Be aware that
    it will not copy maintenance options and remarks.</p>
