{% block content %}
<p>Although every user is assigned to a single subgarden,
  they may still create and edit collections for different subgardens in their garden.
  To do so, after creating a collection by accessing “Add collection” page, select the
  garden you would like to enter data for.
</p>
<p>
  You may notice the plus sign “+” in front of the subgarden names.
  It indicates the subgarden has not been chosen yet.
  After choosing a subgarden, the preceding plus sign “+” will be removed indicating
  it is now available offline.
</p>
<p>
  If you wish to collect in multiple subgardens,
  please also choose them before recording any data as it requires internet
  connection at this stage. You may select between all the available subgardens
  and record data for each one offline afterwards.
</p>
