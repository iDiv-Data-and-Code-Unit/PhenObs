  <p>After you have finished recording data for your collection,
    you need to save it to the database. On the “Add collection”
    and “Edit collection” pages, you can save the collection to
    the database by clicking on the “Done” button at the bottom
    right corner of the form. The button will turn blue and can
    be clicked after you have recorded data for every plant in the
    collection. Clicking on the button, you will save the collection
    to the database and you will see a window appearing to confirm your
    collection was successfully saved.</p>
  <p>
    You can also save the collections in the Local Observations view
    by clicking on the Save button
