  <p>
    To select a plant, you may use the dropdown menu.
    You will notice the plants that have been recorded
    already have a check mark sign “✓” and a green background
    (it may not be visible on mobile devices) indicating it is already saved.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may also sort the plants in both alphabetical order as well as
    numerical order (their orders in the subgarden). To sort the plants,
    please click on the “Sort” button
    (<i class="bi bi-sort-alpha-down offline-feature"></i> or <i class="bi bi-sort-numeric-down offline-feature"></i>)
    next to the “Plant” label.
  </p>
  <p>
    After selection, all fields for the plant are set to default values.
    If you have not changed any of the defaults, before selecting another
    plant, you will be asked to confirm that you do not intend to change
    any values and would like to proceed by clicking on “Yes”.
  </p>
