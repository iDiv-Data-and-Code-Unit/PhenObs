<p>We advise you to use data entry template for Excel which gives you acceptable options for some of the fields and runs checks on values.
However, it is not perfect and is prone to human error. Please double check the entered values, names and dates. Typos may result in corrupt data.
Additional checks are run on the server too, nevertheless wrong data entry that fits the above guidelines will be saved and may end up corrupting the data.</p>

<p><a href="{% static "DataEntryTemplate.xlsx" %}" download>You may download the template by clicking on this link.</a></p>

<p>After the data is entered in Excel, please export the file as CSV before uploading. Make sure to save it as UTF-8 CSV.</p>
<p>
  Be aware, each subgarden needs to be created prior to uploading the CSV file, hence the plants.
  If the mentioned subgardens or plants are not found in the system, you will get an error.
</p>
<p>After you have the full list of plants fitting the above template, please follow the below steps:</p>
