{% block content %}
  In the “Personal Info” section, you may enter personal details of the user.
  <ol>
    <li>Select the “Status of Member” from the dropdown list (student or staff).</li>
    <li>Select the “Organization” [OPTIONAL].</li>
    <li>
      Most of the fields are optional, however, it is recommended at least you enter the full name of the user,
      so, it is easier to distinguish the users.
    </li>
  </ol>
