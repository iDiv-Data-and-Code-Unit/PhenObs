<p>
  A garden may have tens or hundreds of plants in it. Creating each and every plant by hand one
  by one can be an exhausting process. So, there is the option to create multiple plants at a
  time with the help of a CSV file that fits the below template:
</p>
<ol class="" style="font-size: 14pt">
  <li>First column named “Order” indicating the plant’s order in the garden.</li>
  <li>Second column named “Name” indicating plant’s name used in the garden.</li>
  <li>Third column named “Subgarden” indicating which subgarden the plant belongs to.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="{% static "CSV_template.csv" %}" download>You may download the template by clicking on this link.</a></p>
<p>
  Be aware, each subgarden needs to be created prior to uploading the CSV file.
  If the mentioned subgardens are not found in the system, you will get an error.
</p>
<p>After you have the full list of plants fitting the above template, please follow the below steps:</p>
<ol class="" style="font-size: 14pt">
  <li>
    {% include "help/admin/partials/helper_link.html" with id="plants_module" text="Please locate the 'PLANTS' module and click on 'Plants'." %}
