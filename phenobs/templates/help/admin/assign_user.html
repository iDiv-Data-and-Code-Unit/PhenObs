<h1 class="mt-4" id="user_assignment">Assigning user to a subgarden</h1>
<p>
  Users can only be assigned to a <strong>single</strong> subgarden at a time. To assign a user to another
  subgarden, you need to first, unassign them from their current subgarden. For a newly
  created user you only need to assign the user to a subgarden and may skip the next
  section on unassigning.
</p>
<p>To <strong>remove</strong> a user from a subgardenâ€™s access users, please follow the below steps:</p>
<ol class="" style="font-size: 14pt">
  <li>
    {% include "help/admin/partials/helper_link.html" with id="gardens_module3" text="Locate the 'GARDENS' module and click on the 'Gardens' row." %}
    {% include "help/admin/partials/gardens_module.html" with id="gardens_module3"%}
  </li>
  <li>
    {% include "help/admin/partials/helper_link.html" with id="gardens_table" text="Select the subgarden the user currently is assigned to." %}
    {% include "help/admin/partials/gardens_table.html" with id="gardens_table"%}
  </li>
  <li>
    {% include "help/admin/partials/helper_link.html" with id="access_users" text="Remove the user from access users." %}
    {% include "help/admin/partials/access_users.html" with id="access_users"%}
  </li>
  <li>
    Save.
  </li>
</ol>

<br />
<p>After removing the user from their older subgarden, you may now <strong>assign</strong> them to their new subgarden.</p>
<br />
