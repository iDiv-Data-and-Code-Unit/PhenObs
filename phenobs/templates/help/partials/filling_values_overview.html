  <p>Users may enter the values by selecting their responses
    from the dropdown menus with the help of a mouse. However,
    for a faster data entering process you may also try keyboard
    shortcuts. With the help of <code>Tab</code> key you may easily select the
    next field and with the <code>Tab</code> + <code>CTRL</code> key combination you may select
    the previous field.
  </p>
  <p>By entering the first letter of the response you can also easily
    choose the value from a dropdown list. For the flowering intensity
    and senescence intensity values you only need to type in the first
    digit or the whole number.
